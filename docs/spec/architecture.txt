0.   overview

     cartographer is a portable, usable system of tools that present source code
     metadata in a meatbrain-compatible format

I.   lexical analyzer & parser

     we don't write this; when analyzing Java source code we use javac, when
     analyzing C++ we might use parts of gcc

     this component generates a syntax tree and symbol table that are consumed
     by the syntax tree serializer

II.  syntax tree serializer

     this component eats a syntax tree and sometimes a symbol table and poops
     out a JSON representation of the data 

III. data mapper

     this component eats a JSON serialized syntax tree and poops out a YAML
     formatted subset of the data representing some aspect of the source code
     that a meatbrain may find interesting

IV.  visualizer

     this component eats either a JSON representation of a syntax tree or a 
     YAML subset of that data and produces and interesting visual 
     representation of the data, guaranteed to dazzle a meatbrain

V.   host plugin

     this component lives in another application, such as an IDE, and acts as
     a meat brain interface, allowing commands to be issued, data to be read,
     and visualizations to be displayed
